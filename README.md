# vaniaTime
 A project to help new players into MetroidVania!

 In this project, I created a social media related to MetroidVania genre. 
 Where players can talk about their favorite games, post guides and help each other.

 For this project, I used: TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Docker, Jest, Handlebars and CSS.
 I also used some libraries, like: Express-Session, JsonWebToken, Express-Validator, etc.

 The users can: create an account, edit, delete, create their own guides (with images) and comment.
 With this project, I could learn a lot about PostgreSQL and image management on the database. 

 If, for some reason, you want to test the project yourself; you can download it, and use the following commands:

 - npm i
 - npm run dev ./src/index.ts

After that, you're good to go. Have fun!
